                Digital marketing does not necessarily require setting up advertisements through money, it can also be achieved through some free means to attract customers.

                H2 Why is digital marketing important?
                Today's world is more like a community connected by the Internet. You can acquire knowledge, shop and work through the Internet. Compared with traditional marketing, e-marketing can enable you to reach a larger customer group and automatically help your enterprise attract customers.
                If you overlook the importance of digital marketing, it is undoubtedly detrimental to the long-term development of your career. Next, we will introduce four digital marketing strategies for you.

                H2 Types of Digital Marketing
                *Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
                This is the longest profitable but also the slowest way to achieve results. Through SEO, you can push your website or store to the top of search engines such as Google, which can attract a large number of customers.
                But wait, this sounds similar to an advertisement.
                In fact, there is a big difference between SEO and Google Ads. SEO requires technical personnel to operate and plan day after day, without paying salaries to Google, and can generate significant traffic over time. When you need any help with SEO Al tools, you can request our help, and our professional team will promptly answer your questions.
                This approach can not only present the same effect as advertising, but also stay at the top of search engines for a longer period of time than advertising, due to that this free and persistent traffic is loved by many enterprise.
                However, the drawbacks of SEO are also evident, as it requires long-term investment of time and effort, and it is difficult for SEO to achieve the effect of paid advertising in the short term.

                *Email Marketing
                Email Marketing is something that both beginners and veterans of foriegn traders need to know, as it can help sellers find new customers while also maintaining existing ones.
                Compared to SEO, Email Marketing is easier to operate because there are already many email marketing tools available in the market. You can use them to achieve many functions, let's take CusOb as an example.
                It can help you achieve the following:
                1. Send an automatic welcome email to each subscriber.
                2. Automatically send confirmation email when someone wants to collaborate with you.
                3. Send news and newsletters weekly or monthly.
                4. Use AL tools to help you optimize your content.
                This kind of direct marketing email enables deep communication with customers, and it is necessary to listen to their opinions and continuously improve our services in any industry.

                *Social Media Marketing
                Famous social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. have a great influence around the world, and people from all over the world can see the content you post. Of course, the larger your fan base, the more influential your posts will be compared to digital marketing ads.
                But before adopting this strategy, you should first determine the social platform that suits you. If your company belongs to the B2B type, LinkedIn may be more suitable for you than Facebook. Of course, you can choose to operate 3-4 platforms at the same time and find the most suitable platform for yourself.

                *Content Marketing
                Consumers are willing to search for relevant knowledge online before doing something. For example, when you want to buy a good quality piece of clothing online, the first thing you may do is to search for relevant store recommendation articles online. When the content and pictures of the article are novel and reasonable, you will choose to purchase the products recommended by the text. Through such a successful article, businesses can have a powerful channel to attract customers. Because this marketing approach requires high standards for article content, we call it Content Marketing.

                H3 Marketing Strategy of properly using those tools
                The above methods have their advantages and disadvantages. We do not recommend using only one method. Obtaining customer support is not just one aspect. It is based on developing new customers as well as maintaining existing ones. Therefore, when you are ready to implement your own digital marketing services, we recommend that you adopt different digital marketing strategies simultaneously.
                Finally, I hope this digital marketing guide for beginners can help anyone who is striving to start a business.
